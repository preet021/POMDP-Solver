# This is a modified version of term3.pomdp with a smaller number of
# states.  At one point there was a bug in zmdpEvaluate with using
# distinct models for policy generation and evaluation, which caused
# a crash in the case when the evaluation model had more states than
# the policy generation model.  This model is set up to tickle that
# bug.
